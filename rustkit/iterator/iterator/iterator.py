        something that is [`Callable`]. It produces a new iterator which
        calls this closure on each element of the original iterator.

        If you are good at thinking in types, you can think of `map()` like this:
        If you have an iterator that gives you elements of some type `A`, and
        you want an iterator of some other type `B`, you can use `map()`,

        Creates an iterator that both yields elements based on a predicate and maps.

        `map_while()` takes a closure as an argument. It will call this
        closure on each element of the iterator, and yield elements
        while it returns [`Some(_)`][`Some`].

        Examples:
            >>> a = Vec([-1, 4, "0", "abc"])
            >>> it = a.iter().map_while(lambda i: Result.from_(int, i).ok())

            >>> assert it.next() == some(0)
            >>> assert it.next() == NONE

        Here's the same example, but with [`take_while`] and [`map`]:

        [`take_while`]: Iterator.take_while
        [`map`]: Iterator.map

        >>> a = Vec([-1, 4, "NaN", 1])
        >>> it = a.iter()\
        ...       .map(lambda x: Result.from_(int, x).ok())\
        ...       .take_while(Option.is_some)\
        ...       .map(Option.unwrap)

        >>> assert it.next() == some(-1)
        >>> assert it.next() == some(4)
        >>> assert it.next() == NONE

        >>> # Stopping after an initial [`None`]:

        >>> a = Vec([0, 1, 2, "abc", 4, 5])
        >>> it = a.iter().map_while(lambda x: Result.from_(int, x).ok())
        >>> vec = it.collect()

        >>> # We have more elements which could fit in int (4, 5), but `map_while` returned `None` for `abc`
        >>> # (as the `predicate` returned `None`) and `collect` stops at the first `None` encountered.
        >>> assert vec == [1, 2, 3]

        Note that unlike [`take_while`] this iterator is **not** fused.
        It is also not specified what this iterator returns after the first [`None`] is returned.
        If you need fused iterator, use [`fuse`].

        """Transforms an iterator into a collection.

        `collect()` can take anything iterable, and turn it into a relevant
        collection. This is one of the more powerful methods in the standard
        library, used in a variety of contexts.

        The most basic pattern in which `collect()` is used is to turn one
        collection into another. You take a collection, call [`iter`] on it,
        do a bunch of transformations, and then `collect()` at the end.

        `collect()` can also create instances of types that are not typical
        collections. For example, a [`String`] can be built from [`char`]s,
        and an iterator of [`Result[T, E]`][`Result`] items can be collected
        into `Result[Collection[T], E]`. See the examples below for more.

        Because `collect()` is so general, it can cause problems with type
        inference.

        Examples:
            >>> a = Vec[int]([1, 2, 3])
            >>> doubled = a.iter().map((2).__mul__).collect[list[int]]()
            >>> assert doubled == [2, 4, 6]


            >>> # Using `collect()` to make a [`String`]:

            >>> chars = Vec[str](['g', 'd', 'k', 'k', 'n'])
            >>> hello = chars.iter().map(ord).map(lambda x: chr(x + 1)).collect[str]()
            >>> assert hello == "hello"


            >>> # If you have a list of [`Result[T, E]`][`Result`]s, you can use `collect()` to
            >>> # see if any of them failed:

            >>> results = Vec[Result[int, str]]([ok(1), err("nope"), ok(3), err("bad")])
            >>> result = results.iter().collect[Result[Vec[int], str]]()
            >>> # gives us the first error
            >>> assert result == err("nope")


            >>> results = Vec[Result[int, str]]([ok(1), ok(3)])
            >>> result = results.iter().collect[Result[Vec[int], str]]()

            >>> # gives us the list of answers
